            <p>My name is Cameron Billings and I currently live near Detroit, Michigan.  I just graduated from the University of Wisconsin Madison's graduate school with a Masters in Cartography and Geographic Information Systems and am now searching for employment. Since I was a child, I have been insterested in maps and exploring places.  I am seeking to use my extensive education in GIS to launch a career in urban planning or similar field.</p>

            <p style="padding-bottom: 15em">In 2017, for my final project of an Introduction to GIS class, I mapped a phenomenon with a group of students.  We chose to map access to drug treatment centers for low income neighborhooods.  Using ArcGIS, we mapped out several different drug treatment centers and calculated a 1.25 mile radius around the low income neighborhoods to see if the treatments centers were within a walking distance of neighborhoods. </p>

            <p style="padding-bottom: 10em">In Graduate School, I made a bivariate map that was to be added to a longform infographic.  This map showed the relationship between median household income and the percent of people in poverty in Michigan counties. This map was made using Indiemapper.</p>

            <p style="padding-bottom: 14em">Another GIS assignment was to plan a bike route using a shaded relief.  The shaded relief was made using ArcGIS while Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator were used to edit raster colors and vector data.</p>

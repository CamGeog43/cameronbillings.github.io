            <p style="text-align:center">Geography Major / GIS Student</p>

            <p>Hello there.  I am a Geography Major currently enrolled in the GIS program at the University of Wisconsin Madison's Graduate School.  Ever since I was a child, I have always been been insterested in maps and always explore those places.  I am hoping to use my knowledge of maps in urban planning.</p>
    
            <p>Take a look at my <a href="resume.html">Resume</a> for more information.</p>

            <p style="padding-bottom: 15em">In 2017, for the final project of a Introduction to GIS class, I had to map a phenomenon with a group of students.  We chose to map access to drug treatment centers for low income neighborhooods.  Using ArcGIS, we mapped out several different drug treatment centers and calculated a 1.25 mile radius around the low income neighborhoods to see if the treatments centers are within a walking distance of the neighborhoods. </p>

            <p style="padding-bottom: 10em">One of my GIS assignments in Graduate School was make a bivariate map that was to be added to a longform infographic.  This map showing the relationship between median household income and the percent of people in poverty in Michigan counties was made using Indiemapper.</p>

            <p style="padding-bottom: 12em">Another GIS assignment was to plan a bike route using a shaded relief.  The shaded relief was made using ArcGIS while Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator were used to edit raster colors and vector data.</p>
